This repository is complementary resource showing full parametric corner plots from the mock data tests in GravSphere2 presented in Ba침ares-Hern치ndez et al. 2025 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250924103B/abstract).

The naming conventions follow "name of model + line of sight (LOS) or proper motions (PM) + number of tracers + pars_corner.pdf" with Fornax = Fornax simulation, PlumCore / PlumCusp = Gaia Challenge PlumCoreOM / PlumCuspOM model. Plots show marginalized contours and list 68% confidence-level errors centered about the median for each parameter.

For additional information, check the original paper, Ba침ares-Hern치ndez et al. 2025, and the GravSphere2 repository (https://github.com/dadams42/GravSphere2).
